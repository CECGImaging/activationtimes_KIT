* **latDetection:** Detect local activation times (LATs) by finding the peaks in the (positive or negative) temporal derivative. The temporal derivative can additionally be weighted with the norm of the spatial gradient (spatiotemporal mode according to Burak Erem et. al, 2011).

* **latMetrics:** Calculate metrics to quantify the differences between a reference (true) and a reconstructed LAT map.
